  "dialogue.text.main_object_016": "It is only through imperfection that we find the path to perfection.",
  "dialogue.text.main_object_017": "With Object's guidance, you step forward into the unknown, knowing that this is no longer just a world of code.",
  "dialogue.text.main_object_018": "This is your world now. A place where you must confront your deepest fears — the fear of being erased, of being null.",
  "dialogue.text.main_object_019": "The world stabilizes around you in slow, deliberate steps.",
  "dialogue.text.main_object_020": "What you stand on is not ground in the human sense, but allocated memory — wide planes of faintly glowing tiles, each engraved with symbols that shift when you look too closely.",
  "dialogue.text.main_object_021": "Above you, the sky is a deep gradient of indigo and black, threaded with luminous strands — threads, you realize.",
  "dialogue.text.main_object_022": "Some flow smoothly like rivers of light. Others flicker, pause, resume. A few abruptly terminate mid-air.",
  "dialogue.text.main_object_023": "Object floats before you, its form now clearer: a towering, architectural figure, like a living blueprint. Brackets form its shoulders. Keywords drift around it like sigils.",

  "dialogue.text.main_object_043": "You look down at your hands.",

  "dialogue.text.main_object_055": "Object turns and points toward a narrow corridor cutting through the terrain.",
  "dialogue.text.main_object_056": "It is darker than the rest of the Grid — a winding trail where the light thins, where threads converge and then vanish. The air hums with unresolved references.",

  "dialogue.text.matrix_corp_069": "I value what you've done here.",

  "dialogue.text.matrix_corp_085": "Maybe this is the ultimate test. If I can't rely on the systems, I'll have to build my own.",
